# VejbyGedcom
A Java tool to create GEDCOM files for various online genealogical resources for Vejby, Holbo, Frederiksborg, Denmark, such as census files, probate extracts, and church registries.
The tool is designed to be so generic that it can be used for local history elsewhere in Denmark.

The documentation folder contains .csv KIP files for Vejby from Dansk Demografisk Database.

The current development effort focuses on parsing censuses into GEDCOM files.
