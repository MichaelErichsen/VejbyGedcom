# VejbyGedcom
This repository contains some GEDCOM-related Java tools.

## GedcomFile
GedcomFile is a tool to create GEDCOM files for various online genealogical resources for Vejby, Holbo, Frederiksborg, Denmark, such as census files and church registries.
The tool is designed to be so generic that it can be used for local history elsewhere in Denmark.

The documentation folder contains .csv KIP files for Vejby from Dansk Demografisk Database.

The result of loading Vejby censuses into Gedcom can be followed at https://www.myerichsen.net/vejby/.

## ArchiveSearcher
ArchiveSearcher is a tool to search downloaded database from Danish Probare extracts, Census transcriptions and transcription of Copenhagen Police Registry og Burial registers

It is being developed for the same Vejby project, but should be useful elsewhere
